# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to the use of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries when working with empty arrays.  The issue is that using `$in` with an empty array will always return an empty result set, even when you would expect to get documents that match other parts of the query.

This is different from using `$in` with a null or undefined value, where the query may still work correctly.

**Problem**: Using `$in: []` in your MongoDB queries will always result in an empty result set. 

**Solution**: Check the array before executing the query. If empty, change query logic to return appropriate results, or use a different operator entirely.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have MongoDB running locally and have a collection with some sample data.
3. Run `bug.js`. You'll observe an empty result, despite data existing in the collection which would normally satisfy the query's other criteria.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected approach to handle the empty array case.
